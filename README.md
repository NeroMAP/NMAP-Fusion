## 🛠️ Current Contents  
### Configuration Files (`config/`)  
- `preset_categories.yaml`: Behavioral domain classification template  
- `stopwords_custom.yaml`: Custom noise-filtering terms  

> ⚠️ **Non-overwrite Policy**: Existing files are preserved during updates.

## 📋 Planned Methodology  
The protocol will:  
1. Combine coordinate-based and image-based meta-analysis techniques  
2. Incorporate quality control steps for robust results  
3. Follow PRISMA guidelines for systematic review
